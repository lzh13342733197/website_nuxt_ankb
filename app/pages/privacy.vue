        <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Depending on where you live, you may have some or all of the rights listed below in relation to your personal
          information. However, these rights are not absolute, may apply only in certain circumstances and, in certain
          cases, we may decline your request as permitted by law.</p>
        <p>(a) <strong>Right to Access / Know:</strong> You may have a right to request access to personal information
          that we hold about
          you, including details relating to the ways in which we use and share your information.</p>
        <p>(b) <strong>Right to Delete:</strong> You may have a right to request that we delete personal information we
          maintain about you.
        </p>

          information we
          maintain about you.</p>
        <p>(d) <strong>Right of Portability:</strong> You may have a right to receive a copy of the personal information

        <p>(e) <strong>Restriction of Processing:</strong> You may have the right to ask us to stop or restrict our
          processing of personal
          information.</p>
        <p>(f) <strong>Withdrawal of Consent:</strong> Where we rely on consent to process your personal information,
          you
          may have the
          right to withdraw this consent.</p>
        <p>(g) <strong>Appeal:</strong> You may have a right to appeal our decision if we decline to process your

        <p>(h) <strong>Managing Communication Preferences:</strong> We may send you promotional emails, and you may opt
          out of receiving
          these at any time by using the unsubscribe option displayed in our emails to you. If you opt out, we may still
          send you non-promotional emails, such as those about your account or orders that you have made.</p>
        <p>You may exercise any of these rights where indicated on our Site or by contacting us using the contact
          details
          provided below.</p>
        <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights. We may need to collect information
          from you to verify your identity, such as your email address or account information, before providing a
          substantive response to the request. In accordance with applicable laws, you may designate an authorized agent
          to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we
          will
          require that the agent provide proof you have authorized them to act on your behalf, and we may need you to
          verify your identity directly with us. We will respond to your request in a timely manner as required under
          applicable law.</p>

          European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses, or any equivalent contracts issued by the relevant
          competent
          authority of the UK, as relevant, unless the data transfer is to a country that has been determined to provide
          an adequate level of protection.</p>
